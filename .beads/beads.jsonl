In N-way scenarios:\n1. Clone A remaps bd-1 → test-2 → test-4\n2. Clone B remaps bd-1 → test-3 → test-4  \n3. Both try to create test-4, but with different intermediate states\n4. This creates legitimate content collisions that require additional resolution\n\n## Next Steps  \n\nThe full solution requires:\n1. Making remapping fully deterministic across clones (same input → same remapped ID)\n2. OR making `handleRename` more tolerant of mid-flight collisions\n3.

Solution scales to arbitrary N\n2. Performance is acceptable with more clones\n3. Convergence time is bounded\n4. No edge cases in larger collision groups\n\n## Implementation Tasks\n\n### 1. Create TestFiveCloneCollision\nFile: beads_twoclone_test.go (or new beads_nway_test.go)\n\n```go\nfunc TestFiveCloneCollision(t *testing.T) {\n    // Test with 5 clones creating same ID with different content\n    // Verify all 5 clones converge after sync rounds\n    \n    t.Run(\"SequentialSync\", func(t *testing.T) {\n        testNCloneCollision(t, 5, \"A\", \"B\", \"C\", \"D\", \"E\")\n    })\n    \n    t.Run(\"ReverseSync\", func(t *testing.T) {\n        testNCloneCollision(t, 5, \"E\", \"D\", \"C\", \"B\", \"A\")\n    })\n    \n    t.Run(\"RandomSync\", func(t *testing.T) {\n        testNCloneCollision(t, 5, \"C\", \"A\", \"E\", \"B\", \"D\")\n    })\n}\n```\n\n### 2. Implement generalized testNCloneCollision\nGeneralize the 3-clone test to handle arbitrary N:\n\n```go\nfunc testNCloneCollision(t *testing.T, numClones int, syncOrder ...string) {\n    t.Helper()\n    \n    if len(syncOrder) != numClones {\n        t.Fatalf(\"syncOrder length (%d) must match numClones (%d)\", \n            len(syncOrder), numClones)\n    }\n    \n    tmpDir := t.TempDir()\n    \n    // Setup remote and N clones\n    remoteDir := setupBareRepo(t, tmpDir)\n    cloneDirs := make(map[string]string)\n    \n    for i := 0; i \u003c numClones; i++ {\n        name := string(rune('A' + i))\n        cloneDirs[name] = setupClone(t, tmpDir, remoteDir, name)\n    }\n    \n    // Each clone creates issue with same ID but different content\n    for name, dir := range cloneDirs {\n        createIssue(t, dir, fmt.Sprintf(\"Issue from clone %s\", name))\n    }\n    \n    // Sync in specified order\n    for _, name := range syncOrder {\n        syncClone(t, cloneDirs[name], name)\n    }\n    \n    // Final pull for convergence\n    for name, dir := range cloneDirs {\n        finalPull(t, dir, name)\n    }\n    \n    // Verify all clones have all N issues\n    expectedTitles := make(map[string]bool)\n    for i := 0; i \u003c numClones; i++ {\n        name := string(rune('A' + i))\n        expectedTitles[fmt.Sprintf(\"Issue from clone %s\", name)] = true\n    }\n    \n    for name, dir := range cloneDirs {\n        titles := getTitles(t, dir)\n        if !compareTitleSets(titles, expectedTitles) {\n            t.Errorf(\"Clone %s missing issues: expected %v, got %v\", \n                name, expectedTitles, titles)\n        }\n    }\n    \n    t.Log(\"✓ All\", numClones, \"clones converged successfully\")\n}\n```\n\n### 3. Add performance benchmarks\nTest convergence time and memory usage:\n\n```go\nfunc BenchmarkNWayCollision(b *testing.B) {\n    for _, n := range []int{3, 5, 10, 20} {\n        b.Run(fmt.Sprintf(\"N=%d\", n), func(b *testing.B) {\n            for i := 0; i \u003c b.N; i++ {\n                // Run N-way collision and measure time\n                testNCloneCollisionBench(b, n)\n            }\n        })\n    }\n}\n```\n\n### 4. Add convergence time tests\nVerify bounded convergence:\n\n```go\nfunc TestConvergenceTime(t *testing.T) {\n    // Test that convergence happens within expected rounds\n    // For N clones, should converge in at most N-1 sync rounds\n    \n    for n := 3; n \u003c= 10; n++ {\n        t.Run(fmt.Sprintf(\"N=%d\", n), func(t *testing.T) {\n            rounds := measureConvergenceRounds(t, n)\n            maxExpected := n - 1\n            if rounds \u003e maxExpected {\n                t.Errorf(\"Convergence took %d rounds, expected ≤ %d\", \n                    rounds, maxExpected)\n            }\n        })\n    }\n}\n```\n\n### 5. Add edge case tests\nTest boundary conditions:\n- All N clones have identical content (dedup works)\n- N-1 clones have same content, 1 differs\n- All N clones have unique content\n- Mix of collisions and non-collisions\n\n## Acceptance Criteria\n- TestFiveCloneCollision passes with all sync orders\n- All 5 clones converge to identical content\n- Performance is acceptable (\u003c 5 seconds for 5 clones)\n- Convergence time is bounded (≤ N-1 rounds)\n- Edge cases handled correctly\n- Benchmarks show scalability to 10+ clones\n\n## Files to Create/Modify\n- beads_twoclone_test.go or beads_nway_test.go\n- Add helper functions for N-clone setup\n\n## Testing Strategy\n\n### Test Matrix\n| N Clones | Sync Orders | Expected Result |\n|----------|-------------|-----------------|\n| 3        | A→B→C       | Pass            |\n| 3        | C→B→A       | Pass            |\n| 5        | A→B→C→D→E   | Pass            |\n| 5        | E→D→C→B→A   | Pass            |\n| 5        | Random      | Pass            |\n| 10       | Sequential  | Pass            |\n\n### Performance Targets\n- 3 clones: \u003c 2 seconds\n- 5 clones: \u003c 5 seconds\n- 10 clones: \u003c 15 seconds\n\n## Dependencies\n- Requires bd-95, bd-96, bd-115, bd-116 to be completed\n- TestThreeCloneCollision must pass first\n\n## Success Metrics\n- All tests pass for N ∈ {3, 5, 10}\n- Convergence time scales linearly (O(N))\n- Memory usage reasonable (\u003c 100MB for 10 clones)\n- No data corruption or loss in any scenario","status":"closed","priority":2,"issue_type":"task","created_at":"2025-10-29T20:02:47.954306-07:00","updated_at":"2025-10-29T20:02:47.954306-07:00","closed_at":"2025-10-28T20:47:28.317007-07:00"}

UUID-Based IDs\nReplace sequential IDs with UUIDs:\n- Current: bd-1, bd-2, bd-3\n- CRDT: bd-a1b2c3d4-e5f6-7890-abcd-ef1234567890\n- Human aliases maintained separately: #42 maps to UUID\n\n### 2. Last-Write-Wins (LWW) Elements\nEach field becomes an LWW register:\n- title: (timestamp, clone_id, value)\n- status: (timestamp, clone_id, value)\n- Deterministic conflict resolution via Lamport timestamp + clone_id tiebreaker\n\n### 3. Operation Log\nTrack all operations as CRDT ops:\n- CREATE(uuid, timestamp, clone_id, fields)\n- UPDATE(uuid, field, timestamp, clone_id, value)\n- DELETE(uuid, timestamp, clone_id) - tombstone, not hard delete\n\n### 4.

Solution scales to arbitrary N\n2. Performance is acceptable with more clones\n3. Convergence time is bounded\n4. No edge cases in larger collision groups\n\n## Implementation Tasks\n\n### 1. Create TestFiveCloneCollision\nFile: beads_twoclone_test.go (or new beads_nway_test.go)\n\n```go\nfunc TestFiveCloneCollision(t *testing.T) {\n    // Test with 5 clones creating same ID with different content\n    // Verify all 5 clones converge after sync rounds\n    \n    t.Run(\"SequentialSync\", func(t *testing.T) {\n        testNCloneCollision(t, 5, \"A\", \"B\", \"C\", \"D\", \"E\")\n    })\n    \n    t.Run(\"ReverseSync\", func(t *testing.T) {\n        testNCloneCollision(t, 5, \"E\", \"D\", \"C\", \"B\", \"A\")\n    })\n    \n    t.Run(\"RandomSync\", func(t *testing.T) {\n        testNCloneCollision(t, 5, \"C\", \"A\", \"E\", \"B\", \"D\")\n    })\n}\n```\n\n### 2. Implement generalized testNCloneCollision\nGeneralize the 3-clone test to handle arbitrary N:\n\n```go\nfunc testNCloneCollision(t *testing.T, numClones int, syncOrder ...string) {\n    t.Helper()\n    \n    if len(syncOrder) != numClones {\n        t.Fatalf(\"syncOrder length (%d) must match numClones (%d)\", \n            len(syncOrder), numClones)\n    }\n    \n    tmpDir := t.TempDir()\n    \n    // Setup remote and N clones\n    remoteDir := setupBareRepo(t, tmpDir)\n    cloneDirs := make(map[string]string)\n    \n    for i := 0; i \u003c numClones; i++ {\n        name := string(rune('A' + i))\n        cloneDirs[name] = setupClone(t, tmpDir, remoteDir, name)\n    }\n    \n    // Each clone creates issue with same ID but different content\n    for name, dir := range cloneDirs {\n        createIssue(t, dir, fmt.Sprintf(\"Issue from clone %s\", name))\n    }\n    \n    // Sync in specified order\n    for _, name := range syncOrder {\n        syncClone(t, cloneDirs[name], name)\n    }\n    \n    // Final pull for convergence\n    for name, dir := range cloneDirs {\n        finalPull(t, dir, name)\n    }\n    \n    // Verify all clones have all N issues\n    expectedTitles := make(map[string]bool)\n    for i := 0; i \u003c numClones; i++ {\n        name := string(rune('A' + i))\n        expectedTitles[fmt.Sprintf(\"Issue from clone %s\", name)] = true\n    }\n    \n    for name, dir := range cloneDirs {\n        titles := getTitles(t, dir)\n        if !compareTitleSets(titles, expectedTitles) {\n            t.Errorf(\"Clone %s missing issues: expected %v, got %v\", \n                name, expectedTitles, titles)\n        }\n    }\n    \n    t.Log(\"✓ All\", numClones, \"clones converged successfully\")\n}\n```\n\n### 3. Add performance benchmarks\nTest convergence time and memory usage:\n\n```go\nfunc BenchmarkNWayCollision(b *testing.B) {\n    for _, n := range []int{3, 5, 10, 20} {\n        b.Run(fmt.Sprintf(\"N=%d\", n), func(b *testing.B) {\n            for i := 0; i \u003c b.N; i++ {\n                // Run N-way collision and measure time\n                testNCloneCollisionBench(b, n)\n            }\n        })\n    }\n}\n```\n\n### 4. Add convergence time tests\nVerify bounded convergence:\n\n```go\nfunc TestConvergenceTime(t *testing.T) {\n    // Test that convergence happens within expected rounds\n    // For N clones, should converge in at most N-1 sync rounds\n    \n    for n := 3; n \u003c= 10; n++ {\n        t.Run(fmt.Sprintf(\"N=%d\", n), func(t *testing.T) {\n            rounds := measureConvergenceRounds(t, n)\n            maxExpected := n - 1\n            if rounds \u003e maxExpected {\n                t.Errorf(\"Convergence took %d rounds, expected ≤ %d\", \n                    rounds, maxExpected)\n            }\n        })\n    }\n}\n```\n\n### 5. Add edge case tests\nTest boundary conditions:\n- All N clones have identical content (dedup works)\n- N-1 clones have same content, 1 differs\n- All N clones have unique content\n- Mix of collisions and non-collisions\n\n## Acceptance Criteria\n- TestFiveCloneCollision passes with all sync orders\n- All 5 clones converge to identical content\n- Performance is acceptable (\u003c 5 seconds for 5 clones)\n- Convergence time is bounded (≤ N-1 rounds)\n- Edge cases handled correctly\n- Benchmarks show scalability to 10+ clones\n\n## Files to Create/Modify\n- beads_twoclone_test.go or beads_nway_test.go\n- Add helper functions for N-clone setup\n\n## Testing Strategy\n\n### Test Matrix\n| N Clones | Sync Orders | Expected Result |\n|----------|-------------|-----------------|\n| 3        | A→B→C       | Pass            |\n| 3        | C→B→A       | Pass            |\n| 5        | A→B→C→D→E   | Pass            |\n| 5        | E→D→C→B→A   | Pass            |\n| 5        | Random      | Pass            |\n| 10       | Sequential  | Pass            |\n\n### Performance Targets\n- 3 clones: \u003c 2 seconds\n- 5 clones: \u003c 5 seconds\n- 10 clones: \u003c 15 seconds\n\n## Dependencies\n- Requires bd-95, bd-96, bd-97, bd-98 to be completed\n- TestThreeCloneCollision must pass first\n\n## Success Metrics\n- All tests pass for N ∈ {3, 5, 10}\n- Convergence time scales linearly (O(N))\n- Memory usage reasonable (\u003c 100MB for 10 clones)\n- No data corruption or loss in any scenario","status":"closed","priority":2,"issue_type":"task","created_at":"2025-10-29T19:42:29.849243-07:00","updated_at":"2025-10-29T19:42:29.849243-07:00","closed_at":"2025-10-28T22:06:04.398141-07:00"}

In N-way collision scenarios:\n- Clone B sees {test-1} locally, allocates test-2\n- Clone D sees {test-1, test-2, test-3} locally, allocates test-4\n- When same content gets assigned test-2 and test-4, convergence fails\n\nRoot cause: Each clone independently allocates IDs without global coordination, leading to overlapping assignments for the same content.\n\n## Solution\nAdd clone UUID to ID allocation to make every ID globally unique:\n\n**Current format:** `test-1`, `test-2`, `test-3`\n**New format:** `test-1-a7b3`, `test-2-a7b3`, `test-3-c4d9`\n\nWhere suffix is first 4 chars of clone UUID.\n\n## Implementation\n\n### 1. Add clone_identity table\n```sql\nCREATE TABLE clone_identity (\n    clone_uuid TEXT PRIMARY KEY,\n    created_at DATETIME DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP\n);\n```\n\n### 2. Modify getNextIDForPrefix()\n```go\nfunc (s *SQLiteStorage) getNextIDForPrefix(ctx context.Context, prefix string) (string, error) {\n    cloneUUID := s.getOrCreateCloneUUID(ctx)\n    shortUUID := cloneUUID[:4]\n    \n    nextNum := s.getNextCounterForPrefix(ctx, prefix)\n    return fmt.Sprintf(\"%s-%d-%s\", prefix, nextNum, shortUUID), nil\n}\n```\n\n### 3.

If they match, it skips export assuming the issue is already in the JSONL.\n\nThis assumption fails when:\n1. Git operations (pull, reset, checkout) change JSONL without clearing export_hashes\n2. Manual JSONL edits or corruption\n3. Import operations that modify DB but don't update export_hashes\n4. Partial exports that update export_hashes but don't complete\n\n## Impact\n\n- **Critical data loss risk**: Issues appear to be tracked but aren't persisted to git\n- Breaks multi-repo sync (root cause of today's debugging session)\n- Auto-import fails to detect staleness (hash matches despite missing data)\n- Silent data corruption (no error messages, just missing issues)\n\n## Reproduction\n\n1. Have DB with 149 issues, all in export_hashes table\n2. Truncate JSONL to 38 lines (simulate git reset or corruption)\n3. Run `bd export` - it skips 128 issues\n4. JSONL still has only 38 lines but export thinks it succeeded\n\n## Current Workaround\n\n```bash\nsqlite3 .beads/beads.db \"DELETE FROM export_hashes\"\nbd export -o .beads/beads.jsonl\n```\n\n## Proposed Solutions\n\n**Option 1: Verify JSONL integrity before skipping**\n- Count lines in JSONL, compare with export_hashes count\n- If mismatch, clear export_hashes and force full export\n- Safe but adds I/O overhead\n\n**Option 2: Hash-based JSONL validation**\n- Store hash of entire JSONL file in metadata\n- Before export, check if JSONL hash matches\n- If mismatch, clear export_hashes\n- More efficient, detects any JSONL corruption\n\n**Option 3: Disable timestamp-only deduplication**\n- Remove the feature entirely\n- Always export all issues\n- Simplest and safest, but creates larger git commits\n\n**Option 4: Clear export_hashes on git operations**\n- Add post-merge hook to clear export_hashes\n- Clear on any import operation\n- Defensive approach but may over-clear\n\n## Recommended Fix\n\nCombination of Options 2 + 4:\n1. Store JSONL file hash in metadata after export\n2. Check hash before export, clear export_hashes if mismatch  \n3. Clear export_hashes on import operations\n4. Add `bd validate` check for JSONL/export_hashes sync\n\n## Files Involved\n\n- cmd/bd/autoflush.go (shouldSkipExport)\n- cmd/bd/export.go (export with deduplication)\n- internal/storage/sqlite/metadata.go (export_hashes table)","status":"closed","priority":0,"issue_type":"bug","created_at":"2025-10-29T23:05:13.960352-07:00","updated_at":"2025-10-29T23:05:13.960352-07:00","closed_at":"2025-10-29T22:22:20.406934-07:00"}

Create TestFiveCloneCollision\nFile: beads_twoclone_test.go (or new beads_nway_test.go)\n\n```go\nfunc TestFiveCloneCollision(t *testing.T) {\n    // Test with 5 clones creating same ID with different content\n    // Verify all 5 clones converge after sync rounds\n    \n    t.Run(\"SequentialSync\", func(t *testing.T) {\n        testNCloneCollision(t, 5, \"A\", \"B\", \"C\", \"D\", \"E\")\n    })\n    \n    t.Run(\"ReverseSync\", func(t *testing.T) {\n        testNCloneCollision(t, 5, \"E\", \"D\", \"C\", \"B\", \"A\")\n    })\n    \n    t.Run(\"RandomSync\", func(t *testing.T) {\n        testNCloneCollision(t, 5, \"C\", \"A\", \"E\", \"B\", \"D\")\n    })\n}\n```\n\n### 2. Implement generalized testNCloneCollision\nGeneralize the 3-clone test to handle arbitrary N:\n\n```go\nfunc testNCloneCollision(t *testing.T, numClones int, syncOrder ...string) {\n    t.Helper()\n    \n    if len(syncOrder) != numClones {\n        t.Fatalf(\"syncOrder length (%d) must match numClones (%d)\", \n            len(syncOrder), numClones)\n    }\n    \n    tmpDir := t.TempDir()\n    \n    // Setup remote and N clones\n    remoteDir := setupBareRepo(t, tmpDir)\n    cloneDirs := make(map[string]string)\n    \n    for i := 0; i \u003c numClones; i++ {\n        name := string(rune('A' + i))\n        cloneDirs[name] = setupClone(t, tmpDir, remoteDir, name)\n    }\n    \n    // Each clone creates issue with same ID but different content\n    for name, dir := range cloneDirs {\n        createIssue(t, dir, fmt.Sprintf(\"Issue from clone %s\", name))\n    }\n    \n    // Sync in specified order\n    for _, name := range syncOrder {\n        syncClone(t, cloneDirs[name], name)\n    }\n    \n    // Final pull for convergence\n    for name, dir := range cloneDirs {\n        finalPull(t, dir, name)\n    }\n    \n    // Verify all clones have all N issues\n    expectedTitles := make(map[string]bool)\n    for i := 0; i \u003c numClones; i++ {\n        name := string(rune('A' + i))\n        expectedTitles[fmt.Sprintf(\"Issue from clone %s\", name)] = true\n    }\n    \n    for name, dir := range cloneDirs {\n        titles := getTitles(t, dir)\n        if !compareTitleSets(titles, expectedTitles) {\n            t.Errorf(\"Clone %s missing issues: expected %v, got %v\", \n                name, expectedTitles, titles)\n        }\n    }\n    \n    t.Log(\"✓ All\", numClones, \"clones converged successfully\")\n}\n```\n\n### 3. Add performance benchmarks\nTest convergence time and memory usage:\n\n```go\nfunc BenchmarkNWayCollision(b *testing.B) {\n    for _, n := range []int{3, 5, 10, 20} {\n        b.Run(fmt.Sprintf(\"N=%d\", n), func(b *testing.B) {\n            for i := 0; i \u003c b.N; i++ {\n                // Run N-way collision and measure time\n                testNCloneCollisionBench(b, n)\n            }\n        })\n    }\n}\n```\n\n### 4. Add convergence time tests\nVerify bounded convergence:\n\n```go\nfunc TestConvergenceTime(t *testing.T) {\n    // Test that convergence happens within expected rounds\n    // For N clones, should converge in at most N-1 sync rounds\n    \n    for n := 3; n \u003c= 10; n++ {\n        t.Run(fmt.Sprintf(\"N=%d\", n), func(t *testing.T) {\n            rounds := measureConvergenceRounds(t, n)\n            maxExpected := n - 1\n            if rounds \u003e maxExpected {\n                t.Errorf(\"Convergence took %d rounds, expected ≤ %d\", \n                    rounds, maxExpected)\n            }\n        })\n    }\n}\n```\n\n### 5.

Update Response Formatting\nShow aliases in responses:\n\n```python\n@server.call_tool()\nasync def beads_show(issue_id: str) -\u003e List[TextContent]:\n    resolved_id = resolve_issue_id(issue_id)\n    \n    result = subprocess.run(['bd', 'show', resolved_id], ...)\n    \n    # Parse response and add alias info\n    # Format: \"bd-af78e9a2 (alias: #42)\"\n    ...\n```\n\n### 4.

If they match, it skips export assuming the issue is already in the JSONL.\n\nThis assumption fails when:\n1. Git operations (pull, reset, checkout) change JSONL without clearing export_hashes\n2. Manual JSONL edits or corruption\n3. Import operations that modify DB but don't update export_hashes\n4. Partial exports that update export_hashes but don't complete\n\n## Impact\n\n- **Critical data loss risk**: Issues appear to be tracked but aren't persisted to git\n- Breaks multi-repo sync (root cause of today's debugging session)\n- Auto-import fails to detect staleness (hash matches despite missing data)\n- Silent data corruption (no error messages, just missing issues)\n\n## Reproduction\n\n1. Have DB with 149 issues, all in export_hashes table\n2. Truncate JSONL to 38 lines (simulate git reset or corruption)\n3. Run `bd export` - it skips 128 issues\n4. JSONL still has only 38 lines but export thinks it succeeded\n\n## Current Workaround\n\n```bash\nsqlite3 .beads/beads.db \"DELETE FROM export_hashes\"\nbd export -o .beads/beads.jsonl\n```\n\n## Proposed Solutions\n\n**Option 1: Verify JSONL integrity before skipping**\n- Count lines in JSONL, compare with export_hashes count\n- If mismatch, clear export_hashes and force full export\n- Safe but adds I/O overhead\n\n**Option 2: Hash-based JSONL validation**\n- Store hash of entire JSONL file in metadata\n- Before export, check if JSONL hash matches\n- If mismatch, clear export_hashes\n- More efficient, detects any JSONL corruption\n\n**Option 3: Disable timestamp-only deduplication**\n- Remove the feature entirely\n- Always export all issues\n- Simplest and safest, but creates larger git commits\n\n**Option 4: Clear export_hashes on git operations**\n- Add post-merge hook to clear export_hashes\n- Clear on any import operation\n- Defensive approach but may over-clear\n\n## Recommended Fix\n\nCombination of Options 2 + 4:\n1. Store JSONL file hash in metadata after export\n2. Check hash before export, clear export_hashes if mismatch  \n3. Clear export_hashes on import operations\n4. Add `bd validate` check for JSONL/export_hashes sync\n\n## Files Involved\n\n- cmd/bd/autoflush.go (shouldSkipExport)\n- cmd/bd/export.go (export with deduplication)\n- internal/storage/sqlite/metadata.go (export_hashes table)","notes":"## Recovery Session (2025-10-29 21:30)\n\n### What Happened\n- Created 14 new hash ID issues (bd-165 through bd-178) \n- bd sync appeared to succeed\n- Canonical repo (~/src/beads): 162 issues in DB + JSONL ✓\n- Secondary repo (fred/beads): Only 145 issues vs 162 in canonical ✗\n- Both repos on same git commit but different issue counts!\n\n### Bug Manifestation During Recovery\n\n1. **Initial state**: fred/beads had 145 issues, 145 lines in JSONL, 145 export_hashes entries\n\n2. **After git reset --hard origin/main**: \n   - JSONL: 162 lines (from git)\n   - DB: 150 issues (auto-import partially worked)\n   - Auto-import failed with UNIQUE constraint error\n\n3. **After manual import --resolve-collisions**:\n   - DB: 160 issues\n   - JSONL: Still 162 lines\n   - export_hashes: 159 entries\n\n4. **After bd export**: \n   - **JSONL reduced to 17 lines!** ← The bug in action\n   - export_hashes: 159 entries (skipped exporting 142 issues)\n   - Silent data loss - no error message\n\n5. **After clearing export_hashes and re-export**:\n   - JSONL: 159 lines (missing 3 issues still)\n   - DB: 159 issues\n   - Still diverged from canonical\n\n### The Bug Loop\nOnce export_hashes and JSONL diverge:\n- Export skips issues already in export_hashes\n- But those issues aren't actually in JSONL\n- This creates corrupt JSONL with missing issues\n- Auto-import can't detect the problem (file hash matches what was exported)\n- Data is lost with no error messages\n\n### Recovery Solution\nCouldn't break the loop with export alone. Had to:\n1. Copy .beads/beads.db from canonical repo\n2. Clear export_hashes\n3. Full re-export\n4. Finally converged to 162 issues\n\n### Key Learnings\n\n1. **The bug is worse than we thought**: It can create corrupt exports (17 lines instead of 162!)\n\n2. **Auto-import can't save you**: Once export is corrupt, auto-import just imports the corrupt data\n\n3. **Silent failure**: No warnings, no errors, just missing issues\n\n4. **Git operations trigger it**: git reset, git pull, etc. change JSONL without clearing export_hashes\n\n5. **Import operations populate export_hashes**: Even manual imports update export_hashes, setting up future export failures\n\n### Immediate Action Required\n\n**DISABLE EXPORT DEDUPLICATION NOW**\n\nThis feature is fundamentally broken and causes data loss. Should be disabled until properly fixed.\n\nQuick fix options:\n- Set environment variable to disable feature\n- Comment out shouldSkipExport check\n- Always clear export_hashes before export\n- Add validation that DB count == JSONL line count before allowing export\n\n### Long-term Fix\n\nNeed Option 2 + 4 from proposed solutions:\n1. Store JSONL file hash after every successful export\n2. Before export, verify JSONL hash matches expected\n3. If mismatch, log WARNING and clear export_hashes\n4. Clear export_hashes on every import operation\n5. Add git post-merge hook to clear export_hashes\n6.

Move importIssuesCore to internal/import package (shares with daemon)\n2. Use storage layer directly in daemon (create/update issues via Storage interface)\n\n**Blocker:** \nThis is the critical bug causing data corruption:\n- Agent A pushes changes\n- Agent B does git pull\n- Agent B's daemon serves stale SQLite data\n- Agent B exports stale data back to JSONL, overwriting Agent A's changes\n- Agent B pushes, losing Agent A's work\n\n**Next Steps:**\n1.

Create ApplyCollisionResolution function\nNew function to apply all modifications atomically:\n```go\nfunc ApplyCollisionResolution(ctx context.Context, s *SQLiteStorage,\n    result *CollisionResult, mapping map[string]string) error {\n    \n    // Phase 1: Handle renames (delete old IDs)\n    for _, rename := range result.Renames {\n        if err := s.DeleteIssue(ctx, rename.OldID); err != nil {\n            return fmt.Errorf(\"failed to delete renamed issue %s: %w\", \n                rename.OldID, err)\n        }\n    }\n    \n    // Phase 2: Create new IDs (from mapping)\n    // Phase 3: Update references\n    return nil\n}\n```\n\n### 4. Update callers to use two-phase approach\nFile: internal/importer/importer.go (handleCollisions)\n```go\n// Phase 1: Detect (read-only)\ncollisionResult, err := sqlite.DetectCollisions(ctx, sqliteStore, issues)\n\n// Phase 2: Resolve (compute mapping)\nmapping, err := sqlite.ResolveNWayCollisions(ctx, sqliteStore, collisionResult)\n\n// Phase 3: Apply (modify DB)\nerr = sqlite.ApplyCollisionResolution(ctx, sqliteStore, collisionResult, mapping)\n```\n\n### 5. Update tests\n- Verify DetectCollisions doesn't modify DB\n- Test ApplyCollisionResolution separately\n- Add test for rename detection without modification\n\n## Acceptance Criteria\n- DetectCollisions performs zero writes to database\n- DetectCollisions returns RenameDetail entries for content matches\n- ApplyCollisionResolution handles all modifications\n- All existing tests still pass\n- New test verifies read-only detection\n- contentToDBIssue map stays consistent throughout detection\n\n## Files to Modify\n- internal/storage/sqlite/collision.go (DetectCollisions, new function)\n- internal/importer/importer.go (handleCollisions caller)\n- internal/storage/sqlite/collision_test.go (add tests)\n\n## Testing\n- Unit test: DetectCollisions with content match doesn't delete DB issue\n- Unit test: RenameDetail correctly populated\n- Unit test: ApplyCollisionResolution applies renames\n- Integration test: Full flow still works end-to-end\n\n## Risk Mitigation\nThis is a significant refactor of core collision logic.

Collects ALL versions of same logical issue\n2. Sorts by content hash (deterministic)\n3. Assigns sequential IDs based on sorted order\n4. All clones converge to same assignments\n\n## Implementation Tasks\n\n### 1. Create ResolveNWayCollisions function\nFile: internal/storage/sqlite/collision.go\n\nReplace ScoreCollisions with:\n```go\n// ResolveNWayCollisions handles N-way collisions deterministically.\n// Groups all versions with same base ID, sorts by content hash,\n// assigns sequential IDs. Returns mapping of old ID → new ID.\nfunc ResolveNWayCollisions(ctx context.Context, s *SQLiteStorage,\n    collisions []*CollisionDetail, incoming []*types.Issue) (map[string]string, error) {\n    \n    if len(collisions) == 0 {\n        return make(map[string]string), nil\n    }\n    \n    // Group by base ID pattern (e.g., test-1, test-2 → base \"test-1\")\n    groups := groupCollisionsByBaseID(collisions)\n    \n    idMapping := make(map[string]string)\n    \n    for baseID, versions := range groups {\n        // 1. Collect all unique versions by content hash\n        uniqueVersions := deduplicateVersionsByContentHash(versions)\n        \n        // 2. Sort by content hash (deterministic!)\n        sort.Slice(uniqueVersions, func(i, j int) bool {\n            return uniqueVersions[i].ContentHash \u003c uniqueVersions[j].ContentHash\n        })\n        \n        // 3. Assign sequential IDs based on sorted order\n        prefix := extractPrefix(baseID)\n        baseNum := extractNumber(baseID)\n        \n        for i, version := range uniqueVersions {\n            targetID := fmt.Sprintf(\"%s-%d\", prefix, baseNum+i)\n            \n            // Map this version to its deterministic ID\n            if version.ID != targetID {\n                idMapping[version.ID] = targetID\n            }\n        }\n    }\n    \n    return idMapping, nil\n}\n```\n\n### 2. Implement helper functions\n\n```go\n// groupCollisionsByBaseID groups collisions by their logical base ID\nfunc groupCollisionsByBaseID(collisions []*CollisionDetail) map[string][]*types.Issue {\n    groups := make(map[string][]*types.Issue)\n    for _, c := range collisions {\n        baseID := c.ID  // All share same ID (that's why they collide)\n        groups[baseID] = append(groups[baseID], c.ExistingIssue, c.IncomingIssue)\n    }\n    return groups\n}\n\n// deduplicateVersionsByContentHash keeps one issue per unique content hash\nfunc deduplicateVersionsByContentHash(issues []*types.Issue) []*types.Issue {\n    seen := make(map[string]*types.Issue)\n    for _, issue := range issues {\n        if _, found := seen[issue.ContentHash]; !found {\n            seen[issue.ContentHash] = issue\n        }\n    }\n    result := make([]*types.Issue, 0, len(seen))\n    for _, issue := range seen {\n        result = append(result, issue)\n    }\n    return result\n}\n```\n\n### 3. Update handleCollisions in importer\nFile: internal/importer/importer.go\n\nReplace ScoreCollisions call with:\n```go\n// OLD:\nif err := sqlite.ScoreCollisions(ctx, sqliteStore, collisionResult.Collisions, allExistingIssues); err != nil {\n    return nil, fmt.Errorf(\"failed to score collisions: %w\", err)\n}\n\n// NEW:\nidMapping, err := sqlite.ResolveNWayCollisions(ctx, sqliteStore, \n    collisionResult.Collisions, issues)\nif err != nil {\n    return nil, fmt.Errorf(\"failed to resolve collisions: %w\", err)\n}\n```\n\n### 4. Update RemapCollisions\nRemapCollisions currently uses collision.RemapIncoming field. Update to use idMapping directly:\n- Remove RemapIncoming logic\n- Use idMapping to determine what to remap\n- Simplify to just apply the computed mapping\n\n### 5. Add comprehensive tests\n\nTest cases:\n1. 3-way collision with different content → 3 sequential IDs\n2. 3-way collision with 2 identical content → 2 IDs (dedupe works)\n3. Sync order independence (A→B→C vs C→A→B produce same result)\n4. Content hash ordering is respected\n5. Works with 5+ clones\n\n## Acceptance Criteria\n- ResolveNWayCollisions implemented and replaces ScoreCollisions\n- Groups all versions of same ID together\n- Deduplicates by content hash\n- Sorts by content hash deterministically\n- Assigns sequential IDs starting from base ID\n- Returns complete mapping (old ID → new ID)\n- All clones converge to same ID assignments\n- Works for arbitrary N-way collisions\n- TestThreeCloneCollision passes (or gets much closer)\n\n## Files to Modify\n- internal/storage/sqlite/collision.go (new function, helpers)\n- internal/importer/importer.go (call new function)\n- internal/storage/sqlite/collision_test.go (comprehensive tests)\n\n## Testing Strategy\n\n### Unit Tests\n- groupCollisionsByBaseID correctly groups\n- deduplicateVersionsByContentHash removes duplicates\n- Sorting by hash is stable and deterministic\n- Sequential ID assignment is correct\n\n### Integration Tests\n- 3-way collision resolves to 3 issues\n- Sync order doesn't affect final IDs\n- Content hash ordering determines winner\n\n### Property Tests\n- For any N clones with same content, all converge to same IDs\n- Idempotent: running resolution twice produces same result\n\n## Dependencies\n- Requires bd-95 (ContentHash field) to be completed first\n- Requires bd-96 (read-only detection) for clean integration\n\n## Notes\nThis is the core algorithm that enables convergence. The key insight:\n**Sort by content hash globally, not pairwise comparison.**","status":"closed","priority":1,"issue_type":"task","created_at":"2025-10-28T18:37:42.85616-07:00","updated_at":"2025-10-28T20:03:26.675257-07:00","closed_at":"2025-10-28T20:03:26.675257-07:00","dependencies":[{"issue_id":"bd-97","depends_on_id":"bd-94","type":"parent-child","created_at":"2025-10-28T18:39:20.593102-07:00","created_by":"daemon"},{"issue_id":"bd-97","depends_on_id":"bd-95","type":"blocks","created_at":"2025-10-28T18:39:28.30886-07:00","created_by":"daemon"},{"issue_id":"bd-97","depends_on_id":"bd-96","type":"blocks","created_at":"2025-10-28T18:39:28.336312-07:00","created_by":"daemon"},{"issue_id":"bd-97","depends_on_id":"bd-185","type":"parent-child","created_at":"2025-10-29T23:05:13.891541-07:00","created_by":"import-remap"}]}
