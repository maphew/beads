# bd Issue Tracking

## Overview

bd is a graph-based issue tracker for persistent memory across sessions. Use for multi-session work with complex dependencies; use TodoWrite for simple single-session tasks.

## When to Use bd vs TodoWrite

### Use bd when:
- **Multi-session work** - Tasks spanning multiple compaction cycles or days
- **Complex dependencies** - Work with blockers, prerequisites, or hierarchical structure
- **Knowledge work** - Strategic documents, research, or tasks with fuzzy boundaries
- **Side quests** - Exploratory work that might pause the main task
- **Project memory** - Need to resume work after weeks away with full context

### Use TodoWrite when:
- **Single-session tasks** - Work that completes within current session
- **Linear execution** - Straightforward step-by-step tasks with no branching
- **Immediate context** - All information already in conversation
- **Simple tracking** - Just need a checklist to show progress

**Key insight**: If resuming work after 2 weeks would be difficult without bd, use bd. If the work can be picked up from a markdown skim, TodoWrite is sufficient.

**For detailed decision criteria and examples, read:** [references/BOUNDARIES.md](references/BOUNDARIES.md)

## Session Start Protocol

**bd is available when:**
- Project has a `.beads/` directory (project-local database), OR
- `~/.beads/` exists (global fallback database for any directory)

**At session start, always check for bd availability and run ready check:**

1. **Always check ready work automatically** at session start
2. **Report status** to establish shared context

### Quick Start Pattern

```bash
# At session start, run:
bd ready --json

# Report to user:
"I can see X items ready to work on: [brief summary]"

# If using global ~/.beads, note this in report
```

This gives immediate shared context about available work without requiring user prompting.

**Note**: bd auto-discovers the database:
- Uses `.beads/*.db` in current project if exists
- Falls back to `~/.beads/default.db` otherwise
- No configuration needed

### When No Work is Ready

If `bd ready` returns empty but issues exist:

```bash
bd blocked --json
```

Report blockers and suggest next steps.

### Database Selection

bd automatically selects the appropriate database:
- **Project-local** (`.beads/` in project): Used for project-specific work
- **Global fallback** (`~/.beads/`): Used when no project-local database exists

**Use case for global database**: Cross-project tracking, personal task management, knowledge work that doesn't belong to a specific project.

**For complete session start workflows, read:** [references/WORKFLOWS.md](references/WORKFLOWS.md#session-start)

## Core Operations

All bd commands support `--json` flag for structured output when needed for programmatic parsing.

### Essential Operations

**Check ready work:**
```bash
bd ready
bd ready --json              # For structured output
bd ready --priority 0        # Filter by priority
bd ready --assignee alice    # Filter by assignee
```

**Create new issue:**
```bash
bd create "Fix login bug"
bd create "Add OAuth" -p 0 -t feature
bd create "Write tests" -d "Unit tests for auth module" --assignee alice
bd create "Research caching" --design "Evaluate Redis vs Memcached"
```

**Update issue status:**
```bash
bd update issue-123 --status in_progress
bd update issue-123 --priority 0
bd update issue-123 --assignee bob
bd update issue-123 --design "Decided to use Redis for persistence support"
```

**Close completed work:**
```bash
bd close issue-123
bd close issue-123 --reason "Implemented in PR #42"
bd close issue-1 issue-2 issue-3 --reason "Bulk close related work"
```

**Show issue details:**
```bash
bd show issue-123
bd show issue-123 --json
```

**List issues:**
```bash
bd list
bd list --status open
bd list --priority 0
bd list --type bug
bd list --assignee alice
```

## Issue Lifecycle Workflow

### 1. Discovery Phase (Proactive Issue Creation)

**During exploration or implementation, proactively file issues for:**
- Bugs or problems discovered
- Potential improvements noticed
- Follow-up work identified
- Technical debt encountered
- Questions requiring research

**Pattern:**
```bash
# When encountering new work during a task:
bd create "Found: auth doesn't handle profile permissions"
bd dep add current-task-id new-issue-id --type discovered-from

# Continue with original task - issue persists for later
```

**Key benefit**: Capture context immediately instead of losing it when conversation ends.

### 2. Execution Phase (Status Maintenance)

**Mark issues in_progress when starting work:**
```bash
bd update issue-123 --status in_progress
```

**Update throughout work:**
```bash
# Add design notes as implementation progresses
bd update issue-123 --design "Using JWT with RS256 algorithm"

# Update acceptance criteria if requirements clarify
bd update issue-123 --acceptance "- JWT validation works\n- Tests pass\n- Error handling returns 401"
```

**Close when complete:**
```bash
bd close issue-123 --reason "Implemented JWT validation with tests passing"
```

**Important**: Closed issues remain in database - they're not deleted, just marked complete for project history.

### 3. Planning Phase (Dependency Graphs)

For complex multi-step work, structure issues with dependencies before starting:

**Create parent epic:**
```bash
bd create "Implement user authentication" -t epic -d "OAuth integration with JWT tokens"
```

**Create subtasks:**
```bash
bd create "Set up OAuth credentials" -t task
bd create "Implement authorization flow" -t task
bd create "Add token refresh" -t task
```

**Link with dependencies:**
```bash
# parent-child for epic structure
bd dep add auth-epic auth-setup --type parent-child
bd dep add auth-epic auth-flow --type parent-child

# blocks for ordering
bd dep add auth-setup auth-flow
```

**For detailed dependency patterns and types, read:** [references/DEPENDENCIES.md](references/DEPENDENCIES.md)

## Dependency Types Reference

bd supports four dependency types:

1. **blocks** - Hard blocker (issue A blocks issue B from starting)
2. **related** - Soft link (issues are related but not blocking)
3. **parent-child** - Hierarchical (epic/subtask relationship)
4. **discovered-from** - Provenance (issue B discovered while working on A)

**For complete guide on when to use each type with examples and patterns, read:** [references/DEPENDENCIES.md](references/DEPENDENCIES.md)

## Integration with TodoWrite

**Both tools can coexist in a session:**

### Recommended Pattern

1. **Use bd** for project-level issue tracking and dependencies
2. **Use TodoWrite** as "working copy" for current session's active tasks
3. **Sync status**: When completing TodoWrite items, update corresponding bd issues

### Example Flow

```
Session start:
- bd ready shows: "3 issues ready to work on"
- User chooses one: "Let's work on issue-123"
- Create TodoWrite checklist for implementation steps
- bd update issue-123 --status in_progress
- Work through TodoWrite items
- When done: bd close issue-123
- bd ready to see what unblocked
```

**For patterns on transitioning between tools mid-session, read:** [references/BOUNDARIES.md](references/BOUNDARIES.md#integration-patterns)

## Common Patterns

### Pattern 1: Knowledge Work Session

User asks for strategic document development:
1. Check if bd available: `bd ready`
2. If related epic exists, show current status
3. Create new issues for discovered research needs
4. Use discovered-from to track where ideas came from
5. Update design notes as research progresses

### Pattern 2: Side Quest Handling

During main task, discover a problem:
1. Create issue: `bd create "Found: inventory system needs refactoring"`
2. Link using discovered-from: `bd dep add main-task new-issue --type discovered-from`
3. Assess: blocker or can defer?
4. If blocker: `bd update main-task --status blocked`, work on new issue
5. If deferrable: note in issue, continue main task

### Pattern 3: Multi-Session Project Resume

Starting work after time away:
1. Run `bd ready` to see available work
2. Run `bd blocked` to understand what's stuck
3. Run `bd list --status closed --limit 10` to see recent completions
4. Run `bd show issue-id` on issue to work on
5. Update status and begin work

## Issue Creation Guidelines

### When to Ask First vs Create Directly

**Ask the user before creating when:**
- Knowledge work with fuzzy boundaries
- Task scope is unclear
- Multiple valid approaches exist
- User's intent needs clarification

**Create directly when:**
- Clear bug discovered during implementation
- Obvious follow-up work identified
- Technical debt with clear scope
- Dependency or blocker found

**Reason**: Creating issues helps clarify thinking, but for ambiguous knowledge work, discussion refines the task structure first.

### Issue Quality

Use clear, specific titles and include sufficient context in descriptions to resume work later.

**Use --design flag for:**
- Implementation approach decisions, architecture notes, trade-offs considered

**Use --acceptance flag for:**
- Definition of done, testing requirements, success metrics

## Statistics and Monitoring

**Check project health:**
```bash
bd stats
bd stats --json
```

Returns: total issues, open, in_progress, closed, blocked, ready, avg lead time

**Find blocked work:**
```bash
bd blocked
bd blocked --json
```

Use stats to:
- Report progress to user
- Identify bottlenecks
- Understand project velocity

## Advanced Features

### Issue Types

```bash
bd create "Title" -t task        # Standard work item (default)
bd create "Title" -t bug         # Defect or problem
bd create "Title" -t feature     # New functionality
bd create "Title" -t epic        # Large work with subtasks
bd create "Title" -t chore       # Maintenance or cleanup
```

### Priority Levels

```bash
bd create "Title" -p 0    # Highest priority (critical)
bd create "Title" -p 1    # High priority
bd create "Title" -p 2    # Normal priority (default)
bd create "Title" -p 3    # Low priority
```

### Bulk Operations

```bash
# Close multiple issues at once
bd close issue-1 issue-2 issue-3 --reason "Completed in sprint 5"

# Create multiple issues from markdown file
bd create --file issues.md
```

### Dependency Visualization

```bash
# Show full dependency tree for an issue
bd dep tree issue-123

# Check for circular dependencies
bd dep cycles
```

### Built-in Help

```bash
# Quick start guide (comprehensive built-in reference)
bd quickstart

# Command-specific help
bd create --help
bd dep --help
```

## JSON Output

All bd commands support `--json` flag for structured output:

```bash
bd ready --json
bd show issue-123 --json
bd list --status open --json
bd stats --json
```

Use JSON output when you need to parse results programmatically or extract specific fields.

## Troubleshooting

**If bd command not found:**
- Check installation: `bd version`
- Verify PATH includes bd binary location

**If issues seem lost:**
- Use `bd list` to see all issues
- Filter by status: `bd list --status closed`
- Closed issues remain in database permanently

**If dependencies seem wrong:**
- Use `bd show issue-id` to see full dependency tree
- Use `bd dep tree issue-id` for visualization
- Dependencies are directional: `bd dep add from-id to-id` means from-id blocks to-id
- See [references/DEPENDENCIES.md](references/DEPENDENCIES.md#common-mistakes)

**If database seems out of sync:**
- bd auto-syncs JSONL after each operation (5s debounce)
- bd auto-imports JSONL when newer than DB (after git pull)
- Manual operations: `bd export`, `bd import`
